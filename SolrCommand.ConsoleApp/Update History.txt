Updates On 1/7/2011 - Version 1.2.1
•	GetCoreStatus Command
	o	You can now set CoreA and/or CoreB parameters and the output will show status information for both cores side by side for easy comparison.
•	CreateIndex Command
	o	The output now contains the core status summary content before and after the index (and swap) operations.  
•	CreateIndexAndSwap Command
	o	The output now contains the core status summary content before and after the index (and swap) operations.  
•	SwapCores Command
	o	Checks to see if the version of CoreB is greater than the version of CoreA prior to swaping.  If it is not, it increments the version of CoreB until it is greater than CoreA prior to swaping.  This will ensure we never swap into CoreA with a smaller version number.  This also occurs when calling the CreateIndexAndSwap command.
•	Added new parameter named Notify
	o	Set to true to send email containing output from command, or set to false to prevent the email from being sent.  This is optional and defaults to true.
•	Added new command named WatchIndexCreateProgress
	o	You can run this to watch the progress/status of a core that is currently being indexed.
